## [4.0.1](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/swagger-mock-validator/compare/4.0.0...4.0.1) (2018-07-05)


### Bug Fixes

* paths without parameters not matching before paths with parameters ([b0f0f4e](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/swagger-mock-validator/commits/b0f0f4e)), closes [#69](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/swagger-mock-validator/issue/69)

# [4.0.0](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/swagger-mock-validator/compare/3.0.0...4.0.0) (2018-04-13)


### Bug Fixes

* format validators for int32, int64, float and double no longer accept spaces and now test for the full range of accepted values ([a38b085](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/swagger-mock-validator/commits/a38b085)), closes [#67](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/swagger-mock-validator/issue/67)


### BREAKING CHANGES

* Prior to this change the tool used to accept blank spaces in path parameters for int32, int64, float and double formatted numbers. A bug has been fixed to disallow blank spaces. This means some mock responses that were previously considered valid will now be considered invalid. This change has also updated the int64 and double format validators to now test for the full range of values these types support. This means some mock responses that were previously considered invalid will now be considered valid.

It is recommended that consumers and providers coordinate upgrading to this release so that both sides agree on what is considered valid vs invalid.

### Bug Fixes

* allOf validation ignoring required properties and formats ([bae1bb7](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/swagger-mock-validator/commits/bae1bb7)), closes [#32](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/swagger-mock-validator/issue/32)


### Features

* add support for circular references in the swagger file ([dd61f7b](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/swagger-mock-validator/commits/dd61f7b)), closes [#60](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/swagger-mock-validator/issue/60)
* only output mockDetails and specDetails when they relevant ([8486bf8](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/swagger-mock-validator/commits/8486bf8)), closes [#56](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/swagger-mock-validator/issue/56)


### BREAKING CHANGES

* Prior to this change the tool used to disallow additional properties in response mocks unless the schema explicitly allowed additional properties. To support the allOf keyword correctly this behavior has been changed. Now additional properties are allowed in response mocks unless a schema explicitly disallows them. This means some mock responses that were previously considered invalid will now be considered valid. It is recommended that consumers and providers coordinate upgrading to this release so that both sides agree on what is considered valid vs invalid.
* swagger-mock-validator now supports validating schemas containing circular references. Prior to this change schemas containing circular references were ignored. If you have a schema that contains circular references and a mock that is not compatible with that schema the swagger-mock-validator will now fail. It is recommended that consumers and providers coordinate upgrading to this release so that both sides agree on what is considered valid vs invalid.

### BREAKING CHANGES

* The name of the module has changed from “@atlassian/swagger-pact-validator” to “swagger-mock-validator”. To migrate you need to rename the dependency in your package.json and update any code that invokes this cli took from “swagger-pact-validator” to “swagger-mock-validator”.
